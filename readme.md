This repository contains links to publically available shotgun sequencing data and associated metadata. All accessions and relevant metadata and their sources are contained within HuVirDB-1.0-metadata.xlsx and sequencing data is avilable at https://doi.org/10.7272/Q6FX77PX and [opengut.ucsf.edu/HuVirDB-1.0.fasta.gz](https://opengut.ucsf.edu/HuVirDB-1.0.fasta.gz) which may be temporarily unavailable (6.1Gb).

Sequences are identified by their SRA Sample accession listed in the metadata as follows for the sample sequences `>ERS161375|NODE_1_length_42480_cov_14.362430` and `ERS698656|NODE_2_length_95062_cov_1334.516583`:

SRA Sample Accession | Node Identifier | Length of Node (BP)  | Coverage (average kmer)
---------|---------|---------|-----------
ERS161375 | NODE_1 | 42480 |  14.362430
ERS698656 | NODE_2 | 95062 | 1334.516583
